# Diablo Immortal AFK Farm

This AutoHotkey script allows you to run background key presses in Diablo Immortal without taking control of your keyboard, letting you do other work or browse while the game stays active.

## 🔧 Features

- Presses `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` in sequence every second.
- Presses `Q` every 5 seconds.
- Holds down `Space` while active.
- Runs **in the background**, targeting only the Diablo Immortal window.

## 🖥️ Requirements

- Windows OS
- [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed
- Diablo Immortal running (window title must include `"Diablo Immortal"`)

## ▶️ How to Use

1. Download and install AutoHotkey.
2. Download `diablo_immortal.ahk`.
3. Double-click to run it.
